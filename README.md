Hello Everyone!

My name is Austin, and I am computer science major.  I primarily use a dual boot GNU/Linux and Windows machine to code.
I am a member of the Free Software Foundation since February of 2016.
I just joined GitHub last month, and am looking forward to using it to host many interesting projects.

Sincerely,

Austin J. Suddarth
